title: Hi, I’m Kyle.

I'm a coder, a teacher, a writer, and a researcher of nineteenth-century literature.

I’m currently a graduate student in the English department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I work as a research assistant and a teaching assistant. My research uses text mining and topic modeling to explore literary-historical trends in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.

After several years in academia, I’ve decided to seek a new path as a web developer. I’ve always been a hacker---I’ve been using Linux and writing scripts since I was a kid---but I’ve only recently decided to turn this hobby into my career. As much as I love teaching and writing, I love coding more. I believe that technology has the potential to change our world for the better, and I want to be on the front lines helping to do that.

Skills
------

I know my way around Linux and shell scripting---I use Arch Linux at home but I can work with Red Hat- or Debian-based distributions---and have experience deploying sites on Apache and Nginx, as well as cloud providers like Heroku. I’m skilled at developing well-tested and well-documented APIs with Python and responsive user interfaces with Javascript and HTML/CSS/Sass. But of course I’m always looking to learn more!

I'm in an English MA program now, so a lot of the work I've been doing recently has to do with integrating web technologies into literary research. I made [Balladmonger](http://balladmonger.kylerjohnston.com), for example, in an attempt to reimagine the aesthetic of early modern ballads in a twenty-first-century web app.
