title: About Kyle Johnston

I’m a graduate student in the English department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I’m interested in the ways we as humanists use digital tools to both conduct and present our research, and the ways these tools and methodologies can break down disciplinary boundaries and disperse our research to a wider audience. My current research uses text mining and topic modeling to explore literary-historical trends in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.
