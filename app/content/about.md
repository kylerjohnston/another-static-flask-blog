title: About Kyle

I'm a scholar of 19th-century British literature, a coder, a teacher, and a writer.

I’m currently a graduate student in the English department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I work as a research assistant and a teaching assistant. My current research uses text mining and topic modeling to explore literary-historical trends in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.

More broadly, I’m interested in the ways we as humanists can use digital tools to both conduct and present our research, and the ways these tools and methodologies can break down disciplinary boundaries and disperse our research to a wider audience.
