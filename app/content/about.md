title: Hi, I’m Kyle.

I'm a coder, a teacher, a writer, and a researcher of nineteenth-century literature.

I’m currently a graduate student in the English department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I work as a research assistant and a teaching assistant. My research uses text mining and topic modeling to explore literary-historical trends in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. My passion is solving problems with code, and I hope to transition into a career in web development.

You can [take a look at my portfolio]({{ url_for('main.resume') }}) or [check out my Github](http://github.com/kylerjohnston) to see what I've been working on lately.
