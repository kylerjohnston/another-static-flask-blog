Here are some things I’ve made on the internet.

Balladmonger
------------

Python, Flask, Bootstrap<br />

Balladmonger is a small web app built with Python and Flask which dynamically generates a poem&mdash;or a “ballad”&mdash;based on one or more training texts each time the page is loaded. The instance deployed on Heroku is trained on *King Lear* and about two dozen other texts which are themselves based on *King Lear*, ranging from early modern ballads to *Sense and Sensibility* to twenty-first century fanfiction. I developed it for a seminar exploring Shakespearean remediations and the early modern ballad form. See the post [On Sitting Down to Reflect on Making Some Ballads Again](/posts/sitting-down-to-reflect-on-making-some-ballads-again) for more details.

This site
---------

Python, Flask, jQuery and Javascript, HTML and CSS<br />
<a href="/" class="projects"><i class="fa fa-home"></i></a> <a href="http://github.com/kylerjohnston/another-static-flask-blog" class="projects"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

My goal for this project was to make a blog that was really easy to manage. All content is written in markdown. Using Flask-Frozen, the whole site can be exported into static HTML files which can easily be uploaded to Github Pages.
