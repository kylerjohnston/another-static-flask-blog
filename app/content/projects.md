Balladmonger is a small web app built with Python and Flask which dynamically generates a poem&mdash;or a “ballad”&mdash;based on one or more training texts each time the page is loaded. The instance deployed on Heroku is trained on *King Lear* and about two dozen other texts which are themselves based on *King Lear*, ranging from early modern ballads to *Sense and Sensibility* to twenty-first century fanfiction. I developed it for a seminar exploring Shakespearean remediations and the early modern ballad form. See the post [On Sitting Down to Reflect on Making Some Ballads Again]({{ url_for('main.post', post_name='sitting-down-to-reflect-on-making-some-ballads-again') }}) for more details.
