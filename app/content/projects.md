Balladmonger is a small web app built with Python and Flask which dynamically generates a poem---or a “ballad”---based on one or more training texts each time the page is loaded. The instance deployed on Heroku is trained on *King Lear* and about a dozen other texts which are themselves based on *King Lear*, ranging from *Sense and Sensibility* to *Endgame*. I developed it for a seminar exploring Shakespearean remediations and the early modern ballad form. See the post “What Balladmonger is, and how it works” for a description of how it works.
