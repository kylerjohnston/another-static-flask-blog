I do a lot of reading. I like to be able to keep track of it all in some way. I used to use Goodreads, but I don’t really care about the social media-y aspects of the site and it just feels overkill for what I want to do. So here's a plain, simple list of stuff I've been reading lately. I’d like to make this a habit to keep track of my reading progress&mdash;compiling monthly reading lists. This one is short because I just had the idea last week, but hopefully I keep it up.

The spring semester has just started and I’m taking two seminars: one on eighteenth-century British drama, and one on modernism. So most of my reading has to do with one of those two things.

Here’s what I’ve been reading in January, or at least the week of the month:

* Mary Helen McMurran. “The New Cosmpolitanism and the Eighteenth Century.” 1/25
* Christopher J. Wheately. “Tragedy” in *The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre*. 1/26
* Derek Hughes. “Restoration and Settlement: 1660 and 1688” in *The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre*. 1/27
* Marshall Berman. “Introduction” from *All That Is Solid Melts Into Air*. 1/27
* Marshall Berman. “II. All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: Marx, Modernism and Modernization” in *All That Is Solid Melts Into Air*. 1/28
* Edgar Allen Poe. “The Man of the Streets.” 1/28
* Herman Melville. “Bartleby the Scrivener.” 1/29
