Here's a list of the stuff I've been reading lately. I feel like this might be a good way to track my reading progress&mdash;making monthly lists of what I've read. I used to use Goodreads but I find it a hassle to use now; I've just been keeping plain texts lists instead.

Anyway, the spring semester has just started and I’m taking two seminars: one on eighteenth-century British drama, and one on modernism. So most of my reading has been around those two things.

Here’s what I’ve been reading in January, or at least the week:

* Mary Helen McMurran. “The New Cosmpolitanism and the Eighteenth Century.” 1/25
* Christopher J. Wheately. “Tragedy” in *The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre*. 1/26
* Derek Hughes. “Restoration and Settlement: 1660 and 1688” in *The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre*. 1/27
* Marshall Berman. “Introduction” from *All That Is Solid Melts Into Air*. 1/27
* Marshall Berman. “II. All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: Marx, Modernism and Modernization” in *All That Is Solid Melts Into Air*. 1/28
* Edgar Allen Poe. “The Man of the Streets.” 1/28
* Herman Melville. *Bartleby the Scrivener*. 1/29
