This was a strange semester of grad school. I went into it knowing that I was going to be leaving my program in May and that, most likely, I would never be teaching English again---but still, I'd already put a year and a half into this program and moved 1300 miles across the continent for it, so I wanted to finish it and get at least an MA from it. I only needed one course to finish my degree requirements: a seminar on Restoration and early-eighteenth century drama. There has been a ton of criticism trying to recover this oft maligned period of English literature, and at an intellectual level I can (usually) find things to appreciate in these plays. But, damn, they are painful to read, consisting almost entirely of trite "wit" or painfully melodramatic dialogue, flat and disgusting characters, and recycled (bad) plots.[^1]

I'm writing a seminar paper on one of these plays, [George Lillo's *The London Merchant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_London_Merchant). *The London Merchant* differs from the other texts we've read in the seminar in a couple crucial ways. For one, it's the most recent, first performed at [Drury Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane) in 1731 and continuously performed for the basically the rest of the eighteenth century (it was wildly popular), while most of the other texts we read were written between 1670 and 1700. It's also the only play we read that takes as its subject matter the middle (bourgeois, business) class---there isn't a single aristocratic character in it. My hunch is that the bourgeois focus---instead of a focus on expatriated libertines or exotic, foreign aristocracies---provides more points of identification, in an ideological sense, for twenty-first century readers and makes the play still work successfully today.

*The London Merchant*, a tragedy, is the story of George Barnwell, a hapless merchant's apprentice who is enticed to steal from his master and kill his uncle to fund his relationship with the amoral prostitute Millwood. Eighteenth-century audiences responded to the naive Barnwell's downfall with anguished pity. [Lady Mary Wortley Montagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Wortley_Montagu) declared "that whoever did not cry at George Barnwell must deserve to be hanged."[^2] To twenty-first century audiences, I think Barnwell's story, aside from the part where he's hanged at the end, is less pitiful than laugh-out-loud funny. Take this scene for example, after Millwood flirtatiously invites Barnwell into her home for the first time.

> MILLWOOD. The interest I have in all that relates to you---the reason of which you shall know hereafter---excites my curiosity. And were I sure you would pardon my presumption, I should desire to know your real sentiments on a very particular subject.

> BARNWELL. Madam, you may command my poor thoughts on any subject. I have none that I would conceal.

> MILLWOOD. You'll think me bold.

> BARNWELL. No, indeed.

> MILLWOOD. What then are your thoughts of love?

> BARNWELL. If you mean the love of women, I have not thought of it at all. My youth and circumstances make such thoughts improper in me yet. But if you mean the general love we owe to mankind, I think no one has more of it in his temper than myself. ... In an especial manner I love my uncle, and my master, but above all my friend. (1.2.114--132)[^3]

(I imagine [Jack McBrayer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1442113/?ref_=tt_cl_t3) speaking Barnwell's lines as *30 Rock*'s Kenneth Parcell here.)

We respond differently, but we're *still responding*.
