Yesterday I launched [todayiread.xyz](https://todayiread.xyz). Today I Read... is a lightweight app designed to help users keep track of what they're reading and visualize their reading habits.

I've been working on Today I Read... over the past two weekends. I used to use Goodreads when I was in college, but I've found that Goodreads doesn't really work well with the kinds of reading I do in grad school. I don't read many books: I read lots of chapters and journal articles, and I want a way to keep track of those. I also want a way to visualize my reading habits---reading is basically my job right now, and I want to make sure I'm keeping up with it. Plus, charts look cool.

I made Today I Read... to solve these problems. Check it out! Maybe you'll find it helpful too. It's a little rough around the edges now---like I said, I hacked it over basically four days---but it's functional, and I'm going to be working on improving it more over the next few weeks. You can [view the source code on Github](http://github.com/kylerjohnston/todayiread).

You can also access your reading data in JSON format via Today I Read...'s API, so I'll be writing a post analyzing my reading habits some time in the future...
